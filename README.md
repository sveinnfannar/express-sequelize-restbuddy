# Express Sequelize RestBuddy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sveinnfannar/express-sequelize-restbuddy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sveinnfannar/express-sequelize-restbuddy)
> RestBuddy provides a simple, yet powerful abstraction to help reduce the amount of boilerplate code in REST APIs

RestBuddy simply queries your database using [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) depending on the structure of the route and attatches the data to the `req` object.

Here are some examples of how restful routes and query parameters map to database lookups: 
- `GET` `/users` -> paginated results from the `Users` table 
- `GET` `/users?name=john` -> paginated results from the `Users` table where name is equal to "john"
- `GET` `/users/:id` -> the row with a given id from `Users` table or 404
- `GET` `/repos/:user/:repo` -> it also works for one or more arbitrary fields (make sure they are unique and indexed)

It even works for PUTs, POSTs, DELETEs and PATCHs:
- `POST` `/users/:id/todos` -> create a new todo for a specific user
- `PATCH` `/users/:id/todos/:id` -> partially update a specific todo for a specific user
- ..

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install express-sequelize-restbuddy`

// TODO: Add usage example

For more example see [/examples](https://github.com/sveinnfannar/express-sequelize-restbuddy/tree/master/examples) or look at the [tests](https://github.com/sveinnfannar/express-sequelize-restbuddy/tree/master/test).

## API Documentation
TODO: Insert JSDoc markdown here

## Support
If you have any problem or suggestion please open an issue [here](https://github.com/ozinc/express-sequelize-restbuddy/issues).

## Tests
Before running tests for the first time run
`gulp db-prepare`
to create a new postgres database for the tests.

To run all tests:
`gulp test`

### Unit Test
Tests with no external dependencies

`gulp unit-test`

### Integration Tests
Tests that have external dependencies like a database, message queue etc.

`gulp integration-test`

External dependencies:
- PostgreSQL

## Todo
- ~~Get multiple resources support~~
- ~~Get single resource support~~
- ~~Create (put/patch) resource support~~
- ~~Destroy (delete) resource support~~
- ~~Support for relational routes (/repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/:number/commits)~~
- ~~Write some unit tests~~
- ~~Write some integration tests~~
- ~~Attatch the result data to the `req` object instead of sending it and closing the socket~~
- ~~A way to specify the sequelize query and therefor override the query generated by parsing the route~~
- Make PUT replace a resource instead of patching it like PATCH does
- Rename perPage to items (or make it configurable)
- Handle include query param to embed documents
- Handle fields query param to filter fields selected from sequelize
- Support 'not' operator in query params ?field=!value
- Support more, less operators in query params ?field=>value and ?field=<value
- Find a new term for "condition transformers" cause they sound weird
- Add simple examples to README.md
- Return "405 Method Not Allowed" when trying to POST to a specific id
- Allow ordering by multiple fields ?order=name,age

- Send the total entries back to the user use the custom HTTP header: X-Total-Count (Optional)
- Link header pagination? (next, previous, first, last)
- Implement HEAD http method
- Support POST with relations (POST /repos/:owner/:repo/pulls)
- Support PUT to a specific id which does not already exist
